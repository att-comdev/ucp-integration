      "message": "I think it depends on what we consider a \"service\" to be. Divingbell doesn\u0027t have an API like the charts listed in UCP services section. I think it could be considered UCP Infrastructure in the sense that it allows tweaking of bare metal parameters that are relevant to UCP.",

      "message": "I believe the convention of the \"charts\" subdirectory was introduced for components like shipyard, which needed to distinguish between the component\u0027s codebase vs. the code for the chart. For items that are strictly charts (like helm-toolkit and \"ceph\" above), there\u0027s not a need to make this distinction, hence these do not have a charts subdirectory.",
