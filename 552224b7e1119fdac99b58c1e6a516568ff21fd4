      "message": "So I can see where you\u0027re coming from, but consider the following:\n\n1) Some important features are currently under development and will be needed for 1710. These features include oslo.policy integration, rendered-documents endpoint and validations (this includes secret substitution and possibly layering being integrated into rendered-documents).\n2) The problem with pinning is that if we forget to upgrade the pin after each of these major features is merged, we might not immediately notice if there is a bug (e.g. fail fast is good).\n3) Deckhand is also heavily tested so the likelihood that a new feature will break integration is low -- but nonetheless still possible.\n\nGiven the above, I think maybe it be worth doing a pin like 10/10, 1 week before the deadline? \n\nOtherwise, if that\u0027s a bad idea, we\u0027ll simply have to carefully upgrade pins until some cut-off point before 1710 (e.g. 10/10 or whatever).",
