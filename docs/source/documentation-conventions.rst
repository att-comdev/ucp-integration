Documentation
=============
Each UCP component will maintain documentation addressing two audiences:

  #. Consumer documentation
  #. Developer documentation

Consumer Documentation
----------------------
Consumer documentation is that which is intended to be referenced by users of
the component. This includes information about each of the following:

-  Introduction - the purpose and charter of the software
-  Features - capabilies the software has
-  Usage - interaction with the software - e.g. API and CLI documentation
-  Setup/Installation - how an end user would set up and run the software
   including system requirements
-  Support - where and how a user engages support or makes change requests for
   the software

Developer Documentation
-----------------------
Developer documentation is used by developers of the software, and addresses
the following topics:

-  Archiecture and Design - features and structure of the software
-  Inline, Code, Method - documentaiton specific to the fuctions and procedures
   in the code
-  Development Environment - explaining how a developer would need to configure
   a working environment for the software
-  Contribution - how a developer can contribute to the software

Format
------
There are multiple means by which consumers and developers will read the
documentation for UCP components. The two common places for UCP components are
`Github`_ in the form of README and code-based documentation, and
`Readthedocs`_ for more complete/formatted documentation.

Documentation that is expected to be read in Github must exist and may use
either `reStructuredText`_ or `Markdown`_. This generally would be limited to
the README file at the root of the project and/or a documentation directory.
The README should direct users to the published documentation location.

Documentation intended for Readthedocs will use reStructuredText, and should
provide a `Sphinx`_ build of the documentation.

Finding Treasuremap
-------------------
`Treasuremap`_ is a project that serves as a starting point for the larger
Containerized Cloud Platform, and provides context for the Undercloud Platform
component projects.

Undercloud component projects should include the following at the top of the
main/index page of their `Readthedocs`_ documentation:

.. tip::

  {{component name}} is part of the containerized Local Control Plane (cLCP).
  More details may be found by using the `Treasuremap`_
